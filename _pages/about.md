Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the [University of Notre Dame](https://politicalscience.nd.edu/) and a Computational Social Science Faculty Fellow with the [Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/). Additionally, I co-direct with Jeffrey Harden the [Representation and Politics in Legislatures Lab](https://rooneycenter.nd.edu/research/representation-and-politics-in-legislatures-lab/) within the [Rooney Center for American Democracy](https://rooneycenter.nd.edu/) at Notre Dame.   

My research focuses on American politics, with a particular interest in how electoral institutions influence congressional representation, communication, and policymaking. My work has been published in outlets such as  *The Journal of Politics*,  *The American Journal of Political Science*, and  *Legislative Studies Quarterly*. My Google Scholar profile can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CuQqTt4AAAAJ&hl=en).

I received my Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2022, and B.A. in Political Science and International Affairs from the University of Georgia in 2016. My dissertation, *Some Politics Are Still Local: Strategic Position Taking in Congress & Elections*, won the American Political Science Association's [E.E. Schattschneider Award](https://politicalsciencenow.com/rachel-porter-receives-the-2023-e-e-schattschneider-award/) for best dissertation in American government. In this project, I employ an original collection of text data from congressional campaign websites to investigate candidates' strategic campaign position taking on local and national issues.
