Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the [University of Notre Dame](https://politicalscience.nd.edu/) and a faculty affiliate with the [Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/). My research primarily focuses on American politics, with a particular interest in how electoral institutions influence strategic campaign position taking and congressional policymaking. 

My research, employing a new collection of text data on candidates' issue positions in congressional primary elections, is forthcoming in *The Journal of Politics*. I am currently producing a co-authored book manuscript that investigates the growing success of political amateurs at winning seats in Congress. 

I received my Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2022, and B.A. in Political Science and International Affairs from the University of Georgia in 2016. My dissertation, *Some Politics Are Still Local: Strategic Position Taking in Congress & Elections*,  won the American Political Science Association's E.E. Schattschneider Award award for best dissertation in American government.
