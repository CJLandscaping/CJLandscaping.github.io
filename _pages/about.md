Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/) at [the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). I earned my M.A. in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2018 and my B.A. in Political Science and International Affairs from [the University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/) in 2016. My research interests include American politics, U.S. Congress, political parties, and elections. Most recently, my research has focused on how differences in gender and political experience affect candidate self-presentation in primary elections. This work is [forthcoming](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/XFGAYNZHCF8NKH9THTZC/full) in *Political Research Quarterly*. 

In today's ``nationalized" elections, it would seem that parties offer voters the same choices throughout the country, with each candidate in each district running on the same party-driven platform. In my [dissertation](dissertation), I argue that this understanding of modern campaigns for Congress misses the mark. I demonstrate that congressional candidates still "go local," reacting to their specific constituency and taking up issues important to their district. To that end, I show that theories of strategic candidate behavior must be updated to better reflect what locally-oriented campaigning looks like in todayâ€™s era of nationalized politics. Departing from existing work that considers campaigns as either national or local, I conceptualize nationalized and locally-oriented campaigns as opposite ends of a spectrum of choices. For some candidates, "going local" may mean discussing district-specific policies alongside national party positions. For others, a locally oriented campaign strategy may look entirely different. Even in today's era of nationalized politics, I argue that candidates still have significant latitude in *which* party issues they cover and *how* they frame these issues. In other words, for some candidates, "going local" may not involve taking up district-specific issues but, rather, using local considerations to craft their party-driven messages. 

Gathering the data required to assess House campaign issue agendas is a monumental task. To assess campaign strategy in modern elections, I have collected an original data set of text from campaign websites for *all* congressional primary election candidates in 2018 who had an official campaign site. I am currently in the process of collecting text for the 2020 primary elections. I also plan to find, aggregate, and clean website text for a select set of candidates who ran in the 2010-2016 elections. These data are unique in that they provide a near complete picture of modern campaigns for Congres. Once completed, this collection of nearly 5,000 campaign platforms will constitute the first comprehensive collection of text on congressional candidate issue agendas.
