Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the [University of Notre Dame](https://politicalscience.nd.edu/) and faculty affiliate with the [Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/). I received my Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2022, and B.A. in Political Science and International Affairs from the University of Georgia in 2016. My research employs advanced quantitative methods and original data collections to offer new perspectives on established theories about American political institutions. In single-authored and collaborative work, I draw connections between electoral dynamics and elitesâ€™ legislative behavior using tools for natural language processing.  

I am currently producing a book manuscript that investigates trends towards political amateurism in elections for the U.S. House of Representatives. The first half of this book seeks to explain how anti-establishment rhetoric, anti-Washington sentiment, and backlash towards career politicians affect the ways candidates present themselves to voters. The second half of the book traces decreases in legislative productivity and increases in congressional dysfunction back to the growing cohort of inexperienced legislators in Congress. This book manuscript and my other ongoing research employ novel data on the political and professional backgrounds for nearly every congressional primary candidate who ran between 1980 and 2022, as well as an original collection of over 50,000 policy positions from nearly 6,000 websites from recent primary elections.
