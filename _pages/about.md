Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/) at [the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). I earned my M.A. in Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2018 and my B.A. in Political Science and International Affairs from [the University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/) in 2016.

My research interests include American politics, U.S. Congress, political parties, and elections. Most recently, my research has focused on how differences in gender and political experience affect candidate self-presentation in primary elections. This work is [forthcoming](dissertation) in *Political Research Quarterly*. 

My [dissertation](research) explores how a candidateâ€™s personal characteristics and electoral environment influence her position-taking in modern campaigns for Congress. In particular, I assess if and how local considerations play into a candidate's strategic calculus. To evaluate candidate campaign strategy, I use new text data on campaign platforms collected from over 3,000 campaign websites across the 2018 and 2020 elections. Once completed, this corpus will be the first comprehensive data set of congressional campaign platform text.
