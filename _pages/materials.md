In my research agenda, I employ advanced computational methods to answer important questions about American political institutions, with a particular interest in Congress, political parties, and primary elections. More specifically, I focus on how institutions: (1) influence political discourse and (2) impact electoral success. I am eager and able to teach classes on quantitative methods and American politics.

### [Research Statement](/files/porter_research_statement.pdf)
My research employs advanced quantitative methods and original data collections to offer new perspectives on established theories about American political institutions. In single-authored and collaborative work, I explore candidate emergence, success, and campaign behavior in congressional elections. My dissertation extends this research agenda by assessing whether candidates still run on locally-oriented issues in today's "nationalized" campaign environment. Most recently, I have taken an interest in understanding how shifts in electoral trends impact legislative outcomes. TEST123

### [Teaching Portfolio](/files/porter_teaching_portfolio.pdf)
In my approach to teaching, I challenge students to evaluate the way they think about the world around them. My teaching style couples active learning with discussions anchored in current events. This teaching methodology encourages critical thinking on the causes and effects of day-to-day political phenomena, producing students who can tackle challenging questions and provide thoughtful solutions. Inside and outside the classroom, I also prioritize experiential learning. I encourage students to "learn by doing" through the semester-long quantitative projects I assign in my courses and by pursuing collaborations with students in my own research. In the following links, please find my full teaching portfolio, a summary of students' evaluations of my teaching, and full student evaluations for all of my courses taught.
