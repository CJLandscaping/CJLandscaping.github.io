My current work examines how electoral rules and norms (1) influence political discussion, and (2) impact who is successful at winning a seat in Congress. To answer these complex questions, I pair new data on congressional primaries with cutting-edge methodological techniques like text analysis, matching, regression discontinuity, and machine learning.
